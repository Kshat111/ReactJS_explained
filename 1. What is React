Note: Only a basic idea is given for each topic in this file, details will be given later.

INTRODUCTION:

1. React is the library for web and native interfaces.
2. JavaScript works on an imperative approach where we have to explicitly program each and every step of the flow of the web app.
3. React (a library of JS), rather works on a declarative approch (just write your end state, and all set).
4. LIBRARY: collection of pre-written code that you can call upon to help you perform common tasks (like a toolbox, you pick and choose what you need)
5. FRAMEWORK: A structure within which you build your application. It provides a foundation and prescribes a way of doing things (Angular and Vue are frameworks of JS)
6. React provides the tools and components to create UI elements, but it doesn't dictate the structure of your entire application or how you should organize your code.
7. It helps in creating single page application (need not link multiple HTML files together, instead dynamically modify the single HTML file)
8. React works by creating components (a fancy name given to simple functions!)


SETTING UP REACT:

(1) Install NodeJS
(2) Install VS code
(3) Create a new Folder: ReactFolio
(4) Change directory to ReactFolio
(5) npx create-react-app <reactAppNameHere>
(6) cd <reactAppNameHere>
(7) npm start


REACT COMPONENTS:

1. React allows us to break a UI down into independent reusable chunks called as components.
2. They must be captilaized (first letter must be uppercase, else they will not work properly).
3. Import the custom component into the App.js file, that component return a JSX data (can link its CSS file as well). This data is highly user friendly and can't be understood by the browser, therefore it is then converted to a low version language.  

For example,

function Greeting() {
  return <h1>&quot;Hello Guys.&quot;</h1>;
}

WHAT IS JSX (JavaScript XML)?

1. a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file'
2. JSX is syntactic sugar for the React createElement function
3. Most of the time in apps, rendering logic and markup are inherently coupled, but we typically separate them by having our logic and markup in separate files
4. JSX allows React to separate concerns by containing both rendering logic and content in the same place (a component)

KEYS IN REACT:

Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted
(similar to keys in objects in JS)
